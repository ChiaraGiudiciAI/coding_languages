Calculate the Hamming Distance between two DNA strands.

When cells divide, their DNA replicates too.
Sometimes during this process mistakes happen and single pieces of DNA get encoded with the incorrect information.
If we compare two strands of DNA and count the differences between them we can see how many mistakes occurred.
This is known as the "Hamming Distance".

We read DNA using the letters C,A,G and T.
Two strands might look like this:

    GAGCCTACTAACGGGAT
    CATCGTAATGACGGCCT
    ^ ^ ^  ^ ^    ^^

They have 7 differences, and therefore the Hamming Distance is 7.
